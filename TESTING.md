# Testing

Run `ruff format --check .`, `ruff check .`, `mypy src`, `pytest`, and `python -m build`. CI also audits dependencies and runs the supported OS/Python matrix.

## 1.2.0 regression acceptance

Run the complete existing suite plus the new regression fixtures. Confirm the documented command produces the selected output, malformed input remains actionable, and source files remain unchanged. Add per-issue thumbnail selection, hash-verified export inspection and resumable copy staging with collision protection.
